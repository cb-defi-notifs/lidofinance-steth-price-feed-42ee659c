# Price feed for stETH/ETH pair

The feed is used to fetch stETH/ETH pair price in a safe manner, which means that the price
should be expensive to significantly manipulate in any direction.

The price is defined as the amount of ETH wei needed to buy 1 stETH. For example, a price equal
to `10**18` would mean that stETH is pegged 1:1 to ETH.

* **Current price**—current price of stETH on Curve pool. Flashloanable.
* **Historical price**—the price of stETH on Curve pool that was at least 15 blocks ago. May be older than 15 blocks: in that case, the pool price that was 15 blocks ago differs from the "historical price" by no more than `N`%.
* **Safe price range**—the range from `historical price - N%` to `min(historical price + N%, 1)`.
* **Safe price**—the price that's within the safe price range.

The parameter `N` is configured by the price feed admin; we're planning to initially set it to `5%`. See the detailed specification in [specification.md](./specification.md).


## Deployments

The feed is deployed behind an upgradeable proxy, so the contract ABI on Etherscan corresponds to the proxy itself. The feed ABI can be found in [`interfaces/StEthPriceFeed.json`](./interfaces/StEthPriceFeed.json).

* Mainnet: [`0xAb55Bf4DfBf469ebfe082b7872557D1F87692Fe6`](https://etherscan.io/address/0xab55bf4dfbf469ebfe082b7872557d1f87692fe6)


## Price feed interface

* `safe_price() -> (price: uint256, timestamp: uint256)` returns the cached safe price
  and its timestamp.

* `current_price() -> (price: uint256, is_safe: bool, anchor_price: uint256)` returns the current pool price, whether
  the price is safe, and the current historical price.

* `update_safe_price() -> uint256` sets the cached safe price to the max(current pool price, 1)
  given that the latter is safe.

* `fetch_safe_price(max_age: uint256) -> (price: uint256, timestamp: uint256)` returns the cached
  safe price and its timestamp. Calls `update_safe_price()` prior to that if the cached safe
  price is older than `max_age` seconds.


## Deploy variables

* `DEPLOYER` required
* `STABLE_SWAP_ORACLE_ADDRESS` required, address of the Curve pool oracle
* `CURVE_POOL_ADDRESS` required, address of the Curve pool
* `MAX_SAFE_PRICE_DIFFERENCE` optional, min: 0, max: 10000, defaults to 500
* `ADMIN` optional, defaults to `DEPLOYER`
